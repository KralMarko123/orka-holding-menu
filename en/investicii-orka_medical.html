      <h3><a href="https://acibademsistina.mk" target="_blank">Acibadem Sistina Hospital</a></h3>
      <p>Acibadem Sistina is the first private clinical hospital in the country to offer high quality medical services in accordance with world standards for patient healthcare.</p>
      <p>As a brand in the healthcare sector in Macedonia, Sistina has been present since 2001, initially as “Mala Bogorodica – Sistina” Special Hospital for Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p>
      <p>The moments of success, the days when Sistina brand was getting bigger, led to its capacity being expanded, with a significant investment in healthcare, and Sistina grew into a clinical hospital that opened its doors to its patients on April 7, 2010.</p>
      <p>On November 10, 2010, Sistina Hospital achieved another success. With the signing of an affiliation agreement with the largest group of hospitals in Southeast Europe, “Acibadem”, Sistina Hospital created an opportunity to exchange knowledge, experience and education with the medical team of the Turkish healthcare giant.</p>
      <p>In just one year, this successful partnership has grown into a joint venture. Sistina Hospital became part of the Acibadem Healthcare Group, and the healthcareleader’s first hospital outside of Turkey. A year later, Acibadem Sistina became part of the second largest chain of hospitals, the Malaysian group IHH. Entering this Group meant raising the standards in treatment and implementation of cutting-edge technologies and treatment protocols, as well as positioning Macedonia on the healthcare world map.</p>
      <p>Today, Acibadem Sistina Hospital is the largest and most modern private hospital in the region and an example of a success story in the healthcare sector with medical services following modern patient treatment protocols. Using latest methods and techniques, its superior medical staffis available to patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
      <p>Acibadem Sistina occupies an area of 24,000 square meters of indoor space spread over 7 floors. It is equipped with 11 state-of-the-art operating rooms and a capacity of 261 hospital beds and 63 intensive care units (Surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Cardiology and Neonatology).</p>
      <p>In 2016, Acibadem Sistina Hospital was awarded the Gold Seal of Approval for quality and safety by JCI - the world’s most prestigious hospital accreditation organization. In 2019, the hospital was reaccredited, once again confirming that it operates in compliance with world standards. The Golden Seal is a testament to the quality that results from the Hospital’s commitment to providing a safe and effective service to its patients. JCI accreditation ensures that each patient is safe and receiving the best medical care.</p>
      <p>Acibadem Sistina has a renowned team of 150 top specialists, including 12 university professors recognized in the region. The extensive experience of our team is a confirmation of the top healthcare services delivered to our patients and their families. They are ready to solve even the most difficult medical cases.</p>
      <p>Thanks to its multidisciplinary approach, Acibadem Sistina patients receive a highly professional service, from diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation of all diseases.</p>
      <p>Acibadem Sistina is a hospital that enjoys the greatest trust of patients. This is also evidenced by the numbers, which are growing every year. In Acibadem Sistina, 17,000 babies were born in the past decade. Our database registers over 550,000 patients, over 100,000 surgeries, and 700,000 examinations.</p>
      <p>Acibadem Sistina’s treatment success rate is up to 99%. It is the result of the highest degree of commitment and care for our patients.</p>
      <p>The technological capabilities of our hospital provide accurate diagnosis and treatment of all diseases. We are constantly focused on implementing the latest advances in medicine.</p>
      <p>Hospital rooms are specially designed, offering maximum comfort during treatment. A team of experienced and properly trained nurses who are focused on individual care of each patient takes care of patients and their needs in a pleasant atmosphere, 24/7. Integrated care by a team of top specialists allows for pain control and greater patient comfort during treatment.</p>
      <p>A special team controls the hygiene of the hospital every day using microbiological tests. Infection control provides safe treatment and maximum protection against nosocomial infections.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://nefroplus.mk" target="_blank">PHI Nefroplus</a></h3>
      <p>In order to improve the conditions of dialysis centers in the country, in 2014 PHI Nefroplus was established, providing healthcare to more than 630 patients, with more than 83,000 dialysis treatments per year. With its dialysis centers, PHI Nefroplus is present in 10 cities, including Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, Struga, Bitola, Prilep, Kavadarci and Veles, and has invested in the opening of two more centers in Kichevo and Ohrid for the first time in Macedonia.</p>
      <p>PHI Nefroplus was the first institution in Macedonia that ceased using the method of Low-Flux hemodialysis and implemented the most effective European and world modalities of hemodialysis, such as High Flux hemodialysis and On Line-HDF (hemodiafiltration).</p>
      <p>In its centers, it has invested in the most sophisticated hemodialysis equipment globally:</p>
      <ul class="nabrojuvanje">
        <li><span class="crveno m-levo">•</span>	For the needs of all dialysis centers, 156 Cordiax 5008 S devices were procured from the renowned manufacturer Fresenius Medical Care - Germany, which are the latest generation of modern and effective technology for chronic renal replacement therapy, with an option for High Flux hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration.This technology provides maximum protection of the heart and the entire vascular system, which are most commonly subjected to complications and risk factors for hemodialysisin patients with kidney disease. At the same time, it has a safety feature to minimize the risk of external blood loss through venous access monitoring, which is anenormous contribution providing superior safety to patients by monitoring the most sensitive point of dialysis – the venous access.</li>
        <li><span class="crveno m-levo">•</span>	80 chairs and 79 beds were procured exclusively for the purpose of hemodialysis, with an option for their adjustment according to the needs and current health status of each patient, thus preventing side effects and complications that may occur during dialysis, which are part of the daily routine in giving dialysis treatment. The beds and chairs themselves offer functionality, comfort and safety, motorized adjustment of the chairs as needed, continuous adjustment of the footrest, adjustment of buttons with easy positioning, safety button, and option for quick intervention in critical situations.</li>
        <li><span class="crveno m-levo">•</span>	After taking over the dialysis centers, PHI Nefroplus has invested in new and completed the existing water treatment systems (reverse osmosis), so that the quality of treated water is 3-5 mS/cm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the treatment of patients, biocompatible dialysis membranes with cardioprotection have been used for the first time. The primary properties of these filters are: highest level of biocompatibility - Inline Steam Sterilization - which allows the production of sterile and pyrogen free dialyzers and provides biocompatibility without chemical residues; maximum endotoxin retention – the Helixone membrane has a high capacity for super retention of endotoxins, which reduces the risk of inflammation; high performance - High Flux dialysis has advantages over Low-Flux dialysis.</p>
      <p>High-Flux dialyzers also remove medium molecules such as beta 2-microglobulin and prevent the loss of essential blood components such as albumin. Water permeability is much higher than in the Low-Flux dialysis machines. These benefits reduce the risk of CVD and help improve long-term outcomes in our patients. High-Flux membranes improve survival in dialysis patients. High-flux dialysis membranes improve anemia management in dialysis patients.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the design benefits of FX classics membranes are as follows: efficient removal of small and medium molecules, minimal loss of essential blood components, optimized hemodynamics, and optimized dialysate for higher values</p>
      <p><b>Hemodialysis treatment is performed exclusively with ultra clean water.</b></p>
